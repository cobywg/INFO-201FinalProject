These line graphs attempt to understand the relationship between the number of followers compared to the Authentic engagement rate and Engagement average. Both of these lines are pretty symmetrical although the Authentic engagement is consistently a little behind the Engagement average. This means influencers reach similar peaks between Authentic Engagement and Engagement average but Authentic Engagement reaches the same peek but with fewer followers. This may tell us that influencers should focus on retaining followers who are authentically engaged with your content.
